# Jigsaw-puzzle-solving
This project aims to solve the jigsaw puzzle by applying object detection and hand-eye calibration to the robot-vision integrated system
The experimental devices are a robot arm model HIWIN RT605-GB, an industrial camera model Smartek GC1621C, an air vacuum nozzle acting as the end-effector, and a 35-piece jigsaw puzzle. The Emgu3.4.3 and Visual Studio 2019 are leveraged for comparative algorithms implementation.
Therefore, before you use this code, make sure that all the APIs of the Robot, CCD, EMGUCV, and VS have been installed.
